**Current Branch**: `feature/change_structure`  
**Previous Work Branch**: `fix/duplicate_loader`  

---

## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. **Duplicate Loader Issue - RESOLVED**
**Branch**: `fix/duplicate_loader`  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED & TESTED**

#### Problem Identified:
- Application showed duplicate loading indicators
- Green horizontal progress bar (ProgressLoader) ✅ Desired
- Spinning circle loaders within pages ❌ Unwanted
- Created confusing user experience

#### Changes Made:
1. **`src/app/support/page.tsx`**:
   - ✅ Added ProgressLoader import
   - ✅ Replaced spinning circle with ProgressLoader component

2. **`src/app/page.tsx`**:
   - ✅ Added ProgressLoader import
   - ✅ Simplified loading logic to return null (relies on loading.tsx)

3. **Other pages verified**:
   - ✅ `src/app/members/page.tsx` - Already using route-level loading.tsx
   - ✅ Member profile pages - Already using route-level loading.tsx
   - ✅ MembersGrid component - Uses text loading (appropriate)

#### Testing Results:
- ✅ Support page: No spinning loader, green progress bar works
- ✅ Main page: No spinning loader, green progress bar works
- ✅ Navigation: Smooth transitions with only green progress bar
- ✅ No duplicate loading experience remains

#### Commits:
- Latest commit: `e249138` - "Fix: Remove duplicate spinning loaders, keep only green horizontal ProgressLoader"
- All changes committed and pushed to `origin/fix/duplicate_loader`

## 🔍 NEW ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Page Flickering During Navigation

### Problem Analysis:
**User Request**: "Everytime i navigate on the website. It flickers the whole page as it's always trying to load everything. What i want is the header and the navigation bar is consistently there. Doesn't flicker. For example. YouTube."

### Root Cause Investigation:

#### Current Architecture Problems:
1. **❌ No Persistent Layout Structure**
   - Each page completely re-renders entire page structure
   - Header and Navigation components imported and rendered within each page
   - Entire DOM tree rebuilt on every navigation

2. **❌ Authentication Checks in Every Page**
   - Each page has own `useEffect` for session checking
   - Each page shows `LoginPage` when not authenticated
   - Multiple authentication flows instead of centralized

3. **❌ Inconsistent Layout Patterns**
   - Some pages wrap content with `ProfileProvider`
   - Each page defines own background styles
   - Header/Footer rendered individually per page

4. **❌ Loading States Cause Layout Shifts**
   - Each page returns `null` during loading
   - No consistent loading experience

#### Why This Causes Flickering:
- Complete DOM replacement during navigation
- Header/Nav re-mounting on every navigation
- Authentication re-checks per page
- Style re-application each time

## 🎯 PROPOSED SOLUTION: Persistent Layout Architecture

### Implementation Plan:

#### 1. **Create Persistent App Shell**
```
src/app/layout.tsx (Root Layout)
├── AuthProvider (handles all authentication)
├── AppShell (persistent header/nav/footer)
└── children (only main content changes)
```

#### 2. **Centralized Authentication**
- Move all auth logic to single `AuthProvider`
- Eliminate per-page authentication checks
- Handle login redirects at layout level

#### 3. **Persistent Layout Components**
- Header and Navigation stay mounted during navigation
- Only main content area changes
- Consistent background and styling

#### 4. **Optimized Loading States**
- Layout-level loading that doesn't affect header/nav
- Smooth transitions between content areas
- No blank screens or layout shifts

### Files to Create/Modify:
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Add providers and app shell
- `src/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` - New centralized auth
- `src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx` - New persistent shell
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Simplify to content only
- `src/app/members/page.tsx` - Simplify to content only
- `src/app/support/page.tsx` - Simplify to content only

### Expected Benefits:
- ✅ No more page flickering - Header/nav stay persistent
- ✅ Faster navigation - Only content area re-renders
- ✅ Professional UX - Like YouTube's smooth navigation
- ✅ Consistent loading - Unified loading experience
- ✅ Better performance - Reduced re-renders and DOM manipulation

### Professional Standards Confirmation:
- ✅ **YouTube uses this exact pattern**
- ✅ **All major web apps use persistent layouts**
- ✅ **Next.js documentation recommends this approach**
- ✅ **This IS the professional standard**
- ✅ **More scalable than current approach**
- ✅ **Follows Next.js App Router best practices**

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (FOR CONTINUATION)

### Immediate Tasks:
1. **Implement Persistent Layout Architecture**
   - Create `AuthProvider` component
   - Create `AppShell` component
   - Modify root `layout.tsx`
   - Simplify individual page components

2. **Test Navigation Experience**
   - Verify no flickering during navigation
   - Ensure header/nav stay persistent
   - Test loading states
   - Verify authentication flow

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Measure navigation speed improvements
   - Verify reduced re-renders
   - Test on different devices/browsers

### Future Considerations:
- Route groups for different layout types
- Advanced loading states
- Animation transitions
- SEO optimization

## 💡 DEVELOPMENT NOTES

### Key Insights:
- Current structure follows outdated patterns
- Proposed structure aligns with modern Next.js best practices
- YouTube and major web apps use persistent layout approach
- This change will significantly improve user experience

### Technical Decisions:
- Keep ProgressLoader as the primary loading indicator
- Centralize authentication logic
- Use Next.js App Router layout composition
- Maintain existing component functionality

### User Requirements:
- Professional navigation experience like YouTube
- No page flickering
- Consistent header/navigation
- Smooth content transitions
- Maintain current functionality
